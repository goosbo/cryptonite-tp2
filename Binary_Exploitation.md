# Buffer Overflow 0

On analysis of the given source code, I determined the following:
The flag is contained in `flag.txt` and is read into a `char` array `flag`
It reads an input from the user and on occurrence of a SIGSEGV error, it is handled by a function called `sigsegv_handler`
The program exits with a print message.

It is seen that whenever the input is a very large string(buffer overflow created), a sigsegv error is caused.
This seems to be because of the `strcpy` in the vuln function whenever it handles large strings.

The `sigsegv_handle` prints out the flag, so causing a buffer overflow is all you need to get the flag.

```
goosbo@pop-os:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 61459
Input: ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```
