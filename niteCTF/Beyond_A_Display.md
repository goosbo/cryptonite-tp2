# Beyond A Display

On reverse image searching the image provided, I found a metro station that seemed to match called Belvedere Tower station in gurgaon.

After searching for nearby 3d billboards, I find that a 3D billboard was installed in 2022 in DLF cyberhub. [source](https://www.facebook.com/heightsevent/videos/we-are-proud-to-announce-indias-first-3d-led-billboard-ooh-for-vivo-mobile-activ/719037979149631/)

While searching for the manufacturer of said billboard, I saw an article on Hyundai unveiling a 4D billboard at the same location. [4d billboard article](https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/hyundai-creates-indias-first-4d-billboard-experience-for-the-new-hyundai-creta/109435445#:~:text=Hyundai%20Motor%20India%2C%20India's%20leading,25%20till%20February%208%2C%202024) 

Hyundai has a sub-company called Hyundai Spotlight that hosts music events. I found that they had hosted a concert in Bangalore at KTPO in Whitefield on 26th October 2024 and Shankar Ehsaan Loy at played at that event.

Now that I had all the information I needed, I tried different permutations of flag formats until I got the right one.

flag: `nite{Hyundai,Shankar_Ehsaan_Loy,KTPO}`
