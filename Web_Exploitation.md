# Forbidden Paths

It is stated that files existed in the directory `/usr/share/nginx/html/ ` and the flag existed in the directory `/flag`. Since absolute files don't work you have to use a relative path.
The website contains a prompt that reads the file of whatever relative path is inputed. Therefore if you input `../../../../flag.txt`, you get the flag.

flag: `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}`
