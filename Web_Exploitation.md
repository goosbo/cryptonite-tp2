# Forbidden Paths

It is stated that files existed in the directory `/usr/share/nginx/html/ ` and the flag existed in the directory `/flag`. Since absolute files don't work you have to use a relative path.
The website contains a prompt that reads the file of whatever relative path is inputed. Therefore if you input `../../../../flag.txt`, you get the flag.

flag: `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}`

# cookies

After going to the site and entering the value `snickerdoodle` since it was hinting at it, I see this particular value in the cookies of the application.

On trying to enter another cookie like `chocolate chip` cookie, I see that the value is updated to 1.

Therefore I keep incrementing the value until I get the flag.

At the value 18, I get the flag `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_94190c8a}` shown in the site.
